    <h2>What is Pollution?</h2>
    <p align="center">Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity, heat, sound, or light). Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants.</p>
<p align="center">Although environmental pollution can be caused by natural events, the word pollution generally implies that the contaminants have an anthropogenic source – that is, a source created by human activities, such as manufacturing, extractive industries, poor waste management, transportation or agriculture. Pollution is often classed as point source (coming from a highly concentrated specific site, such as a factory, mine, construction site), or nonpoint source pollution (coming from a widespread distributed sources, such as microplastics or agricultural runoff).</p>
    <h2>Types of Pollution</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Air Pollution:</strong> Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances called pollutants in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials. It is also the contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment either by chemical, physical, or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic) and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain).Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena<img src="C:\Users\dell\OneDrive\Pictures\pollution.jpg">

        <li><strong>Water Pollution:</strong> Water pollution (or aquatic pollution) is the contamination of water bodies, with a negative impact on their uses.  It is usually a result of human activities. Water bodies include lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers, reservoirs and groundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants mix with these water bodies. Contaminants can come from one of four main sources. These are sewage discharges, industrial activities, agricultural activities, and urban runoff including stormwater. Water pollution may affect either surface water or groundwater. This form of pollution can lead to many problems. One is the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Another is spreading water-borne diseases when people use polluted water for drinking or irrigation. Water pollution also reduces the ecosystem services such as drinking water provided by the water resource.</li>

        <li><strong>Soil Pollution:</strong>Soil contamination, soil pollution, or land pollution as a part of land degradation is caused by the presence of xenobiotic (human-made) chemicals or other alteration in the natural soil environment. It is typically caused by industrial activity, agricultural chemicals or improper disposal of waste. The most common chemicals involved are petroleum hydrocarbons, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (such as naphthalene and benzo(a)pyrene), solvents, pesticides, lead, and other heavy metals. Contamination is correlated with the degree of industrialization and intensity of chemical substance. The concern over soil contamination stems primarily from health risks, from direct contact with the contaminated soil, vapour from the contaminants, or from secondary contamination of water supplies within and underlying the soil.Mapping of contaminated soil sites and the resulting clean ups are time-consuming and expensive tasks, and require expertise in geology, hydrology, chemistry, computer modelling, and GIS in Environmental Contamination, as well as an appreciation of the history of industrial chemistry..</li>

    <h2>How to Reduce Pollution</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Plant grass, trees and shrubs in bare areas. This is one of the most important things you can do to reduce nonpoint source runoff. The grass, trees and shrubs will reduce and absorb runoff, and their roots will hold the soil together, reducing erosion.</li>
        <li>Put trash in its place. Keep it out of storm drains, where it will clog up the drain or end up in the nearest stream or lake.</li>
        <li>Organize neighborhood cleanups. Go on stream walks in your neighborhood, removing trash and debris as you go. It's fun, a good way to meet your neighbors, and you can learn a lot about the natural environment.</li>
        <li>Recycle plastic, glass, and paper. Less trash means less material in the waste stream, and reducing the waste stream is the goal of all measures to control nonpoint source pollution.</li>
